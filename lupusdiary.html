          I have mega lupus!! What is lupus you ask?
            Well its a chronic disease where your immune system is so overactive that
            it recognizes pretty much all healthy tissue in your body as a THREAT!!
        </p>

          Sounds pretty cool, huh? WELL IT'S NOT. Jk, from a scientific standpoint
          it's like huh?? What are those t cells and b cells up to?? Haha, but from
          a living through it standpoint it's all like "joint pain" this, and
          "I'm always tired" that! But that's what medications are for!
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, I'm poppin hella pillies and I DO have to stick a needle in myself every week,
            but not having that constant pain and stiffness and getting to skip sitting in a chair for an
            hour every month with a needle in my arm for an infusion is worth it!... right?
        </p>
        <p class="text-dark rant">
          You know, sometimes I feel like I've been teleported into the mind of a conspiracy theorist,
          and I come up with all these hair brained conspiracies about how the government is supporting
          companies that make our food, water, air quality and qualilty of life worse so that they can
          continue funneling every penny from those lower than the one percent and lining the pockets of rich men
          with money covered with the blood of sick people that can't afford their medical care and die quietly
          ... But that's just a conspiracy theory... I bet it's just super normal that young women are at an all time high for being diagnosed
          with a chronic illness that takes a year to diagnose, an arm an leg to pay for, to go to a doctor who is overwhelmed by a surplus of patients,
          <img style="margin-right: 2em; float: left; width: 40%;shape-outside: polygon(0 7%, 100% 7%, 100% 53%, 63% 72%, 63% 96%, 0 96%);" src="https://jojoe.neocities.org/images/lupus-info.png" alt="lupus info poster">
          whose overworked nurses get a barely livable wage to do a job harder than that of a doctor, just for your insurance to reject your pre-authorization
          of a life-chaging/saving drug over and over until the money you spent on insurance plan for the year would have been enough to at least start the treatment
          and then the poor get poorer and the rich get richer and when one of the richies <span class="bold">DIES</span> because of what they have
          <span class="bold">DONE</span> it's <span class="bold">MURDER</span>, but when he is directly responsible
          for cutting the corners that are causing normal class people to die <span class="bold">THAT'S NOT MURDER??</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh my! What's come over me! There I go again! Anyways, since I have no power over the invisble
          hand, I'll tell you what I do have control over:
        </p>
        <ul style="position: relative;">
          <li>What doctor I go to! My doctor is cool because she:
            <ul>
              <li>Is a lady</li>
              <li>Listens when I speak</li>
              <li>Is not a doctor, but actually an NP (little tip for my lupus girlies out there, NPs are usually better at connecting, easier to schedule with, and are JUST as qualified as a stinky doctor!!)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>How good I am at following up on my treatment. I am lucky to be able to afford my treatment, so this is how I take advantage of it:
            <ul>
              <li>Take my pills everyday!!</li>
              <li>Personally, I write the time I take my pills on my mirror so I can take them as close to twelve hours apart as I can</li>
              <li>No drinking, no drugs, no smoking, no soda, and as little candy as I can manage (though on some of my harder days I may fall victim to a little sweet treat, BUT I TRY NOT TO!!)</li>
              <li>Sleeping as much as I need (little naps are a must!!)</li>
              <li>Surrounding myself with people who understand and love me (if ur family doesn't care to understand you, get a new one!!)</li>
              <li>Do everything I want to do (to the extent that I can!! Being able to do a little of what you love is better than not doing it at all)</li>
              <li>One leg stands... literally try standing on one leg you unbalanced freak</li>
              <li>I hate it when people watch me do my injection, so I ask my husband to look away (he does #^_^#)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>I work out!... Except when I feel bad, then it time to rest!
            <ul>
              <li>WEIGHT TRAINING!! LIFT HEAVY GOOD FOR YOUR JOINTS AND BALANCE!!</li>
              <li>Running is not good for your lupussy joints, and will hurt you in the long run!</li>
              <li>For cardio, try biking, swimming (my personal favorite!), or if your deadset on running (freak) the eliptical.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Listening to my body!!
            <ul>
              <li>I can tell the difference between "I don't want to work out" and "I can't work out" and you can too!</li>
              <li>The moment I feel a bad pain when doing an exercise, I stop! No need to hurt more</li>
              <li>If I need a nap, I need a nap!! Leave me be!!</li>
              <li>My medications cause me a lot of heartburn. If I know something will cause me to have it, I don't eat it! (unless it's Indian food, then it's worth it)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
