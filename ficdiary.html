              Welcome to my fan-fiction page! Here i will rave over ome of my faves, throw up at narsty stories
              that I think just shouldn't exist and most importantly complain to you about how terrible some
              of these authors are.
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't get me wrong! I love a good fan fiction, even if I'm not even in the fandom, and have even written
              some of my own (never published bc I fear fandom people, of course), but there are just some stories I fear
              do not need to be told! But kudos to all those authors out there who put time and effort into becoming better
              writers by writing even if their writing is shitty and unreadable because their 12 year old minds haven't
              developed far enough to understand how to write good prose. PROPS fanfic writers! You are truly some of
              the bravest souls out there to ever do it!
